## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Before you dive into my work, I want to say how happy I am to have you here.

My name is Harun Onur, and I'm a passionate learner on my journey to becoming a Computer Engineer. While I know that no one earns that title just by claiming it, I am fully committed to working hard and giving my best to achieve that goal. Every day, I take another step forward by learning something new, and pushing myself to the next level. Coding isn't just a skill for meâ€”it's a passion. Whether I'm solving problems for a project or simply coding for fun in my free time, itâ€™s something I always find myself coming back to, especially when Iâ€™m looking for a challenge or trying to improve.

One of the things that brings me the most joy is sharing what Iâ€™ve learned with others. Whether itâ€™s helping friends or discussing ideas with colleagues, I believe that knowledge is best when itâ€™s shared. I also enjoy spending time with my friends, relaxing with a good movie or series, and keeping a balance between work and play.

Currently, Iâ€™m working on an exciting new projectâ€”starting a company. The goal is to create breakthrough innovations and develop solutions that havenâ€™t been seen before. Iâ€™m driven by the idea of pushing boundaries and exploring uncharted territories, and I hope to make a real impact with this venture.

Thank you for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy exploring my work!

## Always dream big!ðŸ’ª
